## Features

* Step-by-step explanation of statistical hypothesis testing methods.
* Examples with sample datasets.
* Visualizations & checking assumptions (normality, independence, etc.).
* Comparison between different test types & when each is appropriate.

  

## When to Use Each Test

| Test       | Use Case                                                              | Key Assumptions                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Z-test     | When population variance is known, or sample size is large (n â‰¥ \~30) | Normality of distribution or large sample size                  |
| T-test     | When population variance is unknown; smaller samples                  | Normality (or near), independent samples (if appropriate)       |
| Chi-square | Categorical data; independence or goodness-of-fit                     | Sufficient expected counts in categories, independence          |
| ANOVA      | Comparing means across more than two groups                           | Homogeneity of variances, independence, normality within groups |
